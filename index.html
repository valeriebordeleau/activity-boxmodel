    <h1>What is a Wombat?</h1>
    <p>Wombats are short-legged, muscular quadrupedal <em>marsupials</em>, native to Australia, approximately 1 metre (40Â in) in length, with short, stubby tails. They are adaptable in habitat tolerance, and are found in forested, mountainous, and heathland areas of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania.</p>

    <h2>Behaviours of the Wombat</h2>
    <p>Wombats dig extensive burrow systems with rodent-like front teeth and powerful claws. One distinctive adaptation of wombats is their backwards pouch. The advantage of a backwards-facing pouch is that when digging, the wombat does not gather soil in its pouch over its young. Although mainly crepuscular and nocturnal, wombats also venture out to feed on cool or overcast days. They are not commonly seen, but leave ample evidence of their passage, treating fences as minor inconveniences to be gone through or under, and leaving distinctive cubic faeces.</p>

    <h3>Other Characteristics</h3>   
    <p>Wombats have an extraordinarily slow metabolism, taking around eight to 14 days to complete digestion, which aids their survival in arid conditions. They generally move slowly.When threatened, however, they can reach up to 40 km/h (25 mph) and maintain that speed for up to 90 seconds.Wombats defend home territories centred on their burrows, and they react aggressively to intruders. The common wombat occupies a range of up to 23 ha (57 acres), while the hairy-nosed species have much smaller ranges, of no more than 4 ha (10 acres) </p>
